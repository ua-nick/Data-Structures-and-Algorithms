# Data Structures and Algorithms

Clean and simple implementation in Go

## Implementation

There are several data structures and algorithms implemented in this project. The list will be replenished with time.

##### Data structures
- Circular Buffer
- Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Stack
- Queue

##### Searching algorithms
- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Jump Search
